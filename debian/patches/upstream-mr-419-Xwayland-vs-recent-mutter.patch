Subject: abstractions/X: allow reading the Xauth file mutter passes to
 Xwayland.
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="utf-8"
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Bug-Debian: https://bugs.debian.org/935058
Origin: https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/merge_requests/419

Applications running under Xwayland in a GNOME+Wayland session need read access
to this file since:

  https://gitlab.gnome.org/jwrdegoede/mutter/commit/a8984a81c2e887623d69ec9989ae8a5025f7bd47

â€¦ that was first included in mutter 3.33.3.

This rule is presumably only needed for GNOME+Wayland sessions, so one could
argue that it should live in abstractions/wayland instead, but Jamie argued that
it should be in the X abstraction because Xwayland is a X server.
